Hey, I'm Ryan Wohler, a first year at NSCC studying game development. I've liked video games for as long as I can remember and am excited to make games for others to play. I have experience with C# and Unity, and some experience with createjs in typescript. I am willing to learn other languages and/or engines.

The pinned repositories are projects that I am proud of from my first year. One of which is a TextRPG I made for class, which I am using to explore procedural map generation. Another is my first attempt at making an FPS, even if it's more of an arcade game than a combat based game. Lastly there's the Game Jam I participated in with a couple classmates of mine. I was in charge of programming the actual gameplay and the leaderboard system. When the targets are hit they have a random chance of exploding, flopping onto the ground, and flopping and then generating a couple more flopping copies of themselves. I assure you the enemies copying themselves is intended.

Hey, I'm Robyn Wohler (legally Ryan Wohler, I haven't done the paperwork to change it yet), a recent graduate from NSCC's game design and programming course. I've liked video games for as long as I can remember and am excited to make games for others to play. I have experience with C# and Unity, and some experience with createjs in typescript. I am willing to learn other languages and/or engines.

The pinned repositories are projects that I am proud of. One of which is a TextRPG I made for class, which I am using to explore procedural map generation. Another is my first attempt at making an FPS, even if it's more of an arcade game than a combat based game. Lastly there's a group project I made with a few classmates. I was our team's lead programmer, in charge of fixing bugs and programming the main antagonist, among other things.

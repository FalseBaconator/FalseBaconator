### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm Ryan Wohler, a first year at NSCC studying game development. I've liked video games for as long as I can remember and am excited to make games for others to play. I have experience with C# and Unity, and some experience with createjs in typescript. I am willing to learn other languages and/or engines.
